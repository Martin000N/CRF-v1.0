# terminal-rendering-framework
Working on a software rendering framework for graphics in the terminal. (EXTREMELY EARLY STAGE)
Uses rasterization.

This is a **single-header library**. If you want to try the example program, you can compile it with 

    "g++ -IPathToInclude example.cpp"
                                  
Documentation will be added once its somewhat clean code. Now its unoptimized, in a really early 
stage aswell as its just all over the place. It mostly serves as a way of storing my code incase
anything gets lost/corrupted.

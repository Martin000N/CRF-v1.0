# terminal-rendering-framework
Working on a software rendering framework for graphics in the terminal. (EXTREMELY EARLY STAGE)

Documentation will be added once its somewhat clean code. Now its unoptimized and just all over the place. It mostly serves as a way of storing my code incase anything gets lost/corupted.
